# perfectly-balanced
This program takes an input String and determines if the string has an equal amount of each different letter that appears in the input. The program runs in one of two modes: normal and bonus. In the regular mode, the input must consist of x's and y's only. In bonus mode, any letter can appear in the input. If the input has the same number of each specific letter, it will print True, otherwise it will print False. If an empty input is entered, it will print True. 

This project was inspired by a post on the subreddit r/dailyprogrammer, Challenge #372
